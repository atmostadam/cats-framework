## Problem Statement
Right now, there is a gap that exists where Therapy Cats are only being offered to hospitals, veternarians, prisons, non-profits, treatment centers and similar facilities due to a lack of trained cats and large mandatory fees. This leaves suffering individuals unable to get the theraputic benefits of trained animal companisionship. This is critically important in apartments, condos, government housing and multi-dwelling units where pets are not allowed without a therapy certification. More of the benefits to owning a Therapy Cat can be found at: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interaction_with_cats#Therapy_cats>

## Technical Objective
1. To compare the performance of modern Java workflow engines and workflow design patterns.
2. To expand my knowledge base and skill set by prototyping programming design patterns, technologies, libraries, frameworks and languages
3. To demo and showcase existing capabilities using an unsolved real world problem.

## Background
Dogs have traditionally held critical roles in society such as service dogs, policy dogs, rescue dogs and therapy dogs. However, there has been substantial research that owning other therapy animals can be effective as well. Although there is currently no standardized certification the way that there is for "Service Dogs" or "Police Dogs", therapy animal are recognized as a critical form of treatment and are often permitted in apartments, airlines, grocery stories and even some workplaces where they would otherwise be prohibited. Although hard to quantify the shortage of Therapy Cats, research shows that resolving this issue will improve the quality of people's lives.

## Repository
Cat Framework library for shared components between workflow engines.
- RESTful APIs
- Database Entity Definitions
- Data Models
- Rules Capabilities
- Orchestration Capabilities
- Java
- Spring Boot
- RESTful Services
- Maven

## Notes
I understand that not everything in this repository meets Martin Fowler or other industry expert's definition of design vs implementation, but this is my best way to compare and contrast technology frameworks as we look for the next latest and greatest frameworks, runes engines and workflow engines.
